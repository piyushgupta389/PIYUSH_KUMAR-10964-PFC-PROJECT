📘 Project Title: Marks Grading and Total Calculation System

🔹 Introduction
The Marks Grading and Total Calculation System is a simple C‑language program designed to calculate the total marks, percentage, and grade of a student based on the marks entered for multiple subjects. It ensures accuracy in evaluation and provides instant results with motivational feedback.

🔹 Why This Project Was Made
- To practice and demonstrate the use of arrays, loops, conditional statements, and basic input/output in C.
- To create a real‑life utility program that mimics how schools and colleges calculate student performance.
- To help beginners understand how logic flows in programming: input → process → output.
- To show how error handling (like invalid marks entry) can be managed in a simple program.

🔹 Utility of the Project
- Educational Tool: Students can quickly calculate their grades without manual effort.
- Error Checking: Prevents invalid marks entry (like >100 or <0).
- Motivation: Provides encouraging messages based on performance, which makes the system more interactive.
- Practical Demonstration: Useful for learning C programming basics like arrays, loops, and conditionals.
- Time Saving: Automates the tedious process of calculating totals and percentages.

🔹 Future Scope
- GUI Version: Convert it into a graphical application using HTML/JavaScript or C++ with graphics.
- Database Integration: Store student records in a database (like MySQL) for long‑term tracking.
- Web Application: Extend it into a web‑based grading system for schools and colleges.
- Advanced Features: Add ranking system, subject‑wise analysis, and performance charts.
- Mobile App: Develop an Android/iOS app for students to check grades instantly.
- AI Feedback: Integrate AI to give personalized study tips based on weak subjects.
